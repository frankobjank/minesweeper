# Minesweeper

Minesweeper implemented with Python 3.11.5 via Raylib. Created for practice creating an application for macOS and getting it to work on Windows and Linux.

To run from command line, create a virtual environment (only for first time setup):

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
```

if running macOS or Linux:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

if running Windows:

```sh
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Requirements:

* cffi
* inflection
* pycparser
* raylib

Use this to install all requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run main.py:

```sh
python3 main.py
```
